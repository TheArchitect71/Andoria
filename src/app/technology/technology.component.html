        <p>
          When browsers were much less capable than today, and JavaScript
          performance was poor, every page was coming from a server. Every time
          you clicked something, a new request was made to the server and the
          browser subsequently loaded the new page.
        </p>
        <mat-card-title>Forward in Time</mat-card-title>
        <p>
          A Single Page Application feels much faster to the user, because
          instead of waiting for the client-server communication to happen, and
          wait for the browser to re-render the page, you can now have instant
          feedback.

        <p>
          When based software need updating, every single device in which the
          application is installed will need individually updating. Compare this
          with a web based application, where a security or functionality update
          can be rolled out to every version of the web application with zero
          downtime, giving users instant access to the updated version of the
          app.
        </p>
        <mat-card-title>Efficiency</mat-card-title>
        <p>
          In addition to making the experience faster to the user, the server
          will consume less resources because you can focus on providing an
          efficient API instead of building the layouts server-side.

        <p>
          As a custom web application is made specifically to your business
          needs, it’s completely flexible and scalable to your business’s
          demands and growth. By only having features and functions which are
          relevant to your business, you’ll reduce training time and can add
          functionality as your business grows.
        </p>
        <mat-card-title>Scalability</mat-card-title>
        <p>
          This makes it ideal if you also build a mobile app on top of the API,
          as you can completely reuse your existing server-side code. Single
          Page Applications are easy to transform into Progressive Web Apps,
          which in turn enables you to provide local caching and to support
          offline experiences for your services.
