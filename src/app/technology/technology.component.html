        <p class="card-text">When browsers were much less capable than today, and
          JavaScript performance was poor, every page was coming from a server.
          Every time you clicked something, a new request was made to the server
          and the browser subsequently loaded the new page.</p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Forward in Time</h5>
        <p class="card-text">A Single Page Application feels much faster to the user, because instead
          of waiting for the client-server communication to happen, and wait for
          the browser to re-render the page, you can now have instant feedback.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Security</h5>
        <p class="card-text">When based software need updating, every single device in which
          the application is installed will need individually updating.
          Compare this with a web based application, where a security or
          functionality update can be rolled out to every version of the web
          application with zero downtime, giving users instant access to the
          updated version of the app.</p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Efficiency</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In addition to making the experience faster to the user, the server will
          consume less resources because you can focus on providing an efficient
          API instead of building the layouts server-side.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Customization</h5>
        <p class="card-text">As a custom web application is made specifically to your business
          needs, it’s completely flexible and scalable to your business’s
          demands and growth. By only having features and functions which
          are relevant to your business, you’ll reduce training time and can
          add functionality as your business grows.</p>
          <h5 class="card-title">Scalability</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This makes it ideal if you also build a mobile app on top of the API, as
          you can completely reuse your existing server-side code. Single Page
          Applications are easy to transform into Progressive Web Apps, which in
          turn enables you to provide local caching and to support offline
          experiences for your services.</p>
