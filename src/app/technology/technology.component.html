        <p class="text-muted">In the past, when browsers were much less capable than today, and
          JavaScript performance was poor, every page was coming from a server.
          Every time you clicked something, a new request was made to the server
          and the browser subsequently loaded the new page.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">When based software need updating, every single device in which
            the application is installed will need individually updating.
            Compare this with a web based application, where a security or
            functionality update can be rolled out to every version of the web
            application with zero downtime, giving users instant access to the
            updated version of the app.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">Web applications store information on remote service, so as long
            as you know your URL (web address), user name and password, you
            can log-in securely to any computer or mobile device connected to
            the internet and your business can be up and running again in no
            time.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">As a custom web application is made specifically to your business
            needs, it’s completely flexible and scalable to your business’s
            demands and growth. By only having features and functions which
            are relevant to your business, you’ll reduce training time and can
            add functionality as your business grows.</p>

        A Single Page Application feels much faster to the user, because instead
        of waiting for the client-server communication to happen, and wait for
        the browser to re-render the page, you can now have instant feedback.

        In addition to making the experience faster to the user, the server will
        consume less resources because you can focus on providing an efficient
        API instead of building the layouts server-side.

        This makes it ideal if you also build a mobile app on top of the API, as
        you can completely reuse your existing server-side code. Single Page
        Applications are easy to transform into Progressive Web Apps, which in
        turn enables you to provide local caching and to support offline
        experiences for your services
